Alfredo Lopez: A Look at the Political Landscape
internet a place where women and people of color are attacked 
they're attcked because it's one of the rare mediums where marginalized voices can be heard -- don't need to go thru the normal racist / sexist / classist avenues (mainstream media, etc)
online world allows people to magnify their voice. five people can sound like 35. online tools makes this possible. online bullying. 
internet realm is a great tool of struggle. that is why people need to attack it.
enourmous tool. in the 60s and 70s, mass groups of people could not mobilize in a couple hours. 
THEY don't want women using the internet, it's too much of a danger, a powerful tool.
censorship is a major threat. we have to take person measures to protect ourselves. cannot only rely on authorities for protection.

Renee Bracey & Dan Staples: What You Can Do When Faced with Online Harrassment (Doxxing, etc)
Tools to digitally protect ourselves and to fight back

Tips:
 - Turn off geolocation on all social media and devices -- especially at events
 - google and talkwalker alerts
    - talkwalker alerts are fast at scanning news articles for your name, etc
    - good for getting heads up for potential attacks
 - document harrassment
    - screen shot, take note of URLS
    - trollers will often delete comments so they can't get banned
 - don't use open wifi networks for important or private work
    - open wifi is exposed, all exposed text
    - use a VPN to protect browsing
 - google doc sharing
    - sharing permissions, careful with sharing confidential info. email accounts can get hacked and doc info would be leaked
    - delete docs that don't need to be shared anymore
 - passwords and two-factor authenication
 - registering domains with WHOIS privacy
    - if you run a website, bought a domain name, you need to register contact info. 

Social Media:
    Facebook:
        - limit public posting
        - change settings on images -- make it all private
        - tagging approval
        - only friend people you know
        - close messages

Holistic Approach to Security
    - security is an ongoing process, things are always changing
    - requires regular and frequent checkins

Harm reduction framework for digital security
    - we're doing work that people don't like
    - there are people out there who want to inhibit this
    - work to understand the risks we face, prioritize the risks we deal with, how and when
    - work within resource limitations
    - all approaches should put our larger politics at the fore

Key Concepts of digital security:
    - confientiality
    - data integrity
        - people could tamper with data to harm organizing
        - send false info
        - corruption of data
        - ppl inpersonating others
        - fake, slandering content on website
    - availability
        - access data when you need to
        - DDOS attacks
        - deletion data
        - ransom-ware -- special virus that locks the data unless you pay hacker

Risk Assessment Part 1: 
    Inventory   
        - inventory of information: what information do you have to protect
        - who might want to compromise your information's confidentiality, integrity, availability
            - political opponents
            - disgruntled staff and volunteers
            - garden-variety internet criminals
        - what are the consequences?
    Likelihood 
        - how can your information be accessed? how vulnerable are the places where you keep things?
        - look at low-hanging fruit - what are the serious consequences 
        - 

Best practices:
    Backups
        - protect data integrity, availability
        - make sure backups are what you need incase you need to use it
        - where / how they're stored
        - good to have redundancy in backups
        - one saved in office, one out of office
        - antivirus and software updates (! DAC is not good about this)
        - password: 2 factor authentication
        - unupdated software means that security flaws are publically announced
        - unique passwords for all accounts
        - compartmentalize info
        - responsible data management
            - delete files that are not needed, especially critical information






Buy-in is important for digial security
org needs to feel invested
need to understand consequences
needs to be easy enough for people to use
